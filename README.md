# Single-Cell-RNA-Seq-and-Trajectory-Analysis
Python-based single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline for mouse wild-type and malaria-infected samples. Includes quality control, clustering, differential expression, integration methods comparison, and trajectory inference using Scanpy. Developed as coursework for MSc Bioinformatics 2024/25, University of Glasgow.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a complete single-cell RNA-seq analysis using Scanpy. The notebook includes all code, detailed explanations, and figures covering:

* Data quality assessment
* Clustering and annotation
* Differential expression analysis with multiple integration methods
* Trajectory inference using PAGA

### Usage

* Open `sc_rna_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
* Follow the step-by-step code and comments for analysis and interpretation.
* Ensure required Python packages are installed (Scanpy, harmonypy, matplotlib, etc.).

### Data

The notebook expects raw count matrices in directories named `WT1`, `Infected1`, and `Infected2` under a local `/data` folder or equivalent. Make changes in path if necessary
